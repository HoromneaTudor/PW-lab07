      <h5 class="w3-center">About Blender</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Blender is a open-source 3D modeling software that since 2015 has started making waves in the industri, expecially nou in 2021 Blender is as capable as it has ever been. A lot of 3D artists have switched to it, cause of the fact that its free, and it has a powerfull set of features.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">My passion for Blender started an the 3rd year of university (I am doing Computer Science) when i had a group project where we had to do a game (a 3D game in our case) and we had to make the assets, or at least the main character(I requested it :)). I was put in charge with this task (I like to draw in my free time so I thouth it would be a good way of improving my skills).
        At first it was a bit intimidating, it was a lot to learn, but the fact that i knew that i had all i need in one place was nice (I also had a good understanding of human anatomy and a basic understanding of maps and texturing). The time passed by and the character was taking form, I had to redo it a couple of times because of some mistakes that i made along the way but it was ok, I was getting faster and more acoustomed with the tools.
        The fact that i needed to make a character optimized for games was another problem (the triangle cont and stuff like that), but it was fun to learn methods that are used in industries like retopology, normal maps, etc... Since then i am still hooked and I am still learning the tools that Blender offers(even tho Blender is allways changing and improving with new features), I encurage you tu give it a try, not necesary to make a character(since that is one of the hardest task there is to a 3D arthist since the attention is allways at him), 
        maybe you whant to try to make a tree or a house (eather optimezed for a game engine or not).
